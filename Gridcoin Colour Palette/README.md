# Gridcoin Colour Palette
<p>The Gridcoin colour palette is meant to be used as a guide for creating correctly branded materials.</p>

<p>Presently, the palette is in it's infancy and more work is needed before it's more refined, but the goal is to have a palette which is broad enough to complete most tasks with, yet restricted enough to become a recognisable colour set.</p>

<h3>Future considerations:<h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Print</strong> - Will take a look into producing some CMKY or Pantone values.</li>
<li><strong>Colour contrast</strong> - Will produce a list of colour combos to ensure colour usage is accessible to those who are partially sighted.</li>
<li>...and more tbc.</li>
</ul>
